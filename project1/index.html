                <p>Kanye West, legal name Ye, (born June 8, 1977, Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.), American producer, rapper, and fashion designer who parlayed his production success in the late 1990s and early 2000s into a career as a popular, critically acclaimed solo artist.</p>

                <p>West, the child of a photographer and former Black Panther father and a college professor mother, grew up in Chicago and attended Chicago State University for one year before dropping out to pursue a career in music. Early on he demonstrated his considerable abilities as a producer, contributing to Jermaine Dupri’s album Life in 1472 (1998) before relocating to the New York City area, where he made his name with his production work for Roc-A-Fella Records, especially on rapper Jay-Z’s album Blueprint (2001). West’s skillful use of accelerated sample-based beats soon made him much in demand as a producer, but he struggled to be allowed to make his own recordings (partly because of the perception that his middle-class background denied him credibility as a rapper). When he finally released his debut solo album, The College Dropout (2004), it was massively successful: sales soared, and critics gushed over its sonic sophistication and clever wordplay, which blended humour, faith, insight, and political awareness on songs such as “Through the Wire” and the gospel-choir-backed “Jesus Walks.” The latter cut won a Grammy Award for best rap song in 2005, and West also picked up awards that year for best rap album and best rhythm-and-blues song (as one of the songwriters of Alicia Keys’s “You Don’t Know My Name”).</p>

        <section class="personallife">
            <div class="pl">
                <p>While acting as producer to the stars, West cut his own demo (a recording that gives listeners an idea of the style and ability of the musician) and began shopping it around. Despite his solid reputation, no one returned his calls. Then in 2002, Roc-A-Fella Records, the label that signed Jay-Z, decided to give West a chance as a rapper. The company already knew he was a talented record producer. West signed a record deal that year and began recording in the studio.</p>

                <p>"My [future] is in God's hands. If He wants me to make another album, then He'll give me the inspiration to do so. I can't force it."</p>
                    
                <p>On the way home from a recording session in Los Angeles, West fell asleep at the wheel and was involved in a head-on car collision that left him with a broken face and fractured jaw. The artist nearly died in the crash. He endured months of recovery, including reconstructive surgery that left his jaw wired shut. That didn't stop West from moving forward with the album. He explained the ordeal to Ebony magazine: "I feel like the album was my medicine. It would take my mind away from the pain— away from the dental appointments, from my teeth killing me, from my mouth being wired shut, from the fact that I looked like I just fought [boxer] Mike Tyson.... I nearly died. That's the best thing that can happen to a rapper."</p>
                    
                <p>So with his jaw wired shut, West returned to the recording studio to sing on a regular basis until he was satisfied with his debut release. One song in particular, "Through the Wire," was the first track of several singles on The College Dropout to become a raging hit. The song chronicles West's ordeal. The album itself, which was released in 2004, went multiplatinum, selling 2.6 million copies. "The best thing is being able to get my creative ideas out," West told Ebony. "That's why I rap in the first place—so my voice can be heard."</p>
                    
                <p>College Dropout was hailed as one of the best albums of the year. Critics praised West for taking hip-hop in a new direction. Songs on the album focus on walking with God while trying to "be real," and the producer/rapper says it all with a gospel choir backing him up. Hip-hop violinist Miri Ben-Ari worked with West on the album. Ben-Ari told Ebony, "He has a vision for things, for example, to bring live instrumentalists back to the game and create music like they did back in the day. Kanye is very open to new things; he is not afraid to think differently, to take a chance and to say his thoughts out loud."</p>
                    
                <p>interview on UniversalUrban.com called West "one of a precious few rappers with actually something to say in his songs." West admits to writing lyrics on topics that aren't usually covered in rap music. "It's like if you wanna rap like Jay [Jay-Z], it's hard to rap like Jay and not rap about what Jay is rapping about," he told UniversalUrban. "Once I found out exactly how to rap about drugs and exactly how to rap about say no to drugs, I knew that I could fill the exact medium between that. Just think about whatever you've been through in the past week, and I have a song about that on my album."</p>
                    
                <p>West won four Billboard Music Awards in 2004: Male New Artist of the Year, New R…B/Hip-Hop Artist of the Year, R…B/ Hip-Hop Producer of the Year, and Rap Artist of the Year.</p>

                <p>West's debut album The College Dropout was released in February 2004, it debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, and was certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in June 2004. In August 2005, West released his second studio album Late Registration, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 860,000 copies. The album was the ninth best-selling album of 2005 in the United States.</p> 
                
                <p>In September 2007, West's third studio album Graduation debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 957,000 units in its first week, becoming the fastest-selling album in the US since Late Registration, and breaking the record for most digital albums sold in a week. West's fourth studio album 808s & Heartbreak was released in November 2008, and became his third consecutive number one release on the Billboard 200.</p>

                <p>November 2010, West released his fifth studio album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with the fourth-highest ever digital first-week sales. Watch the Throne, a collaborative album with Jay-Z, was released in August 2011 and broke the US iTunes first-week sales record. Compilation album Cruel Summer released with his label GOOD Music in September 2012 debuted atop the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. West's sixth studio album Yeezus was released in June 2013 and debuted at number one in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.</p>

                <p>The Life of Pablo was released in February 2016, and made history by becoming the first album to top the Billboard 200 predominantly from streaming, while also having the second-highest total of first-week streams for an album. In June 2018, West released both his eighth studio album Ye, and his second collaborative album Kids See Ghosts (with Kid Cudi). The former recorded the second-highest ever per-track streaming average for an album. Following multiple delays, West released his ninth studio album Jesus Is King in late-October 2019. The album became West's first to top Top Christian Albums, and Top Gospel Albums charts, and made him tie Eminem as the only other act to have nine successive studio albums debut at number one on the Billboard 200.</p>
